                Marc is a hard working, talented and exceedingly professional
                music director with a strong, natural musical ear. He has
                demonstrated the ability to work quickly and effectively in a
                variety of rehearsal environments with singers and
                instrumentalists. Marc is a clear communicator who possesses the
                ability to help a performer or ensemble reach their highest
                potential. Having had success as both a performer and a music
                director, he is keenly aware of how best to support fellow
                musicians in rehearsals and performances. As he has proven to be
                a fine musician, I would happily work with Marc again on any
                musical project.

                    I have had the pleasure of creating with Marc on diverse
                    work over the years. He is so innovative and calm in his
                    approach. He takes direction, yet offers ideas and solutions
                    throughout development of the creative process! A gifted
                    arranger, he understands and really gets inside the head of
                    the client or creative! He is always able to get the best
                    out of vocalists, musicians and casts.{' '}

                    Always prepared, the quality of work he delivers is so
                    impressive going above and beyond to make sure that the end
                    result is the best it can be.{' '}

                    From creating, arranging, vocal, sound, working alongside
                    choreography, video and lights, he ensures his work runs
                    inline to complement. He is easily adaptable but more than
                    anything Marc is a joy to create with!{' '}

                    As a musical director, Marc McBride has many strengths both
                    on and off the stage.{' '}

                    He is a superb musician who performs effortlessly, a
                    confident and respected leader who motivates by example, and
                    a perfectionist with a great sense of humor and tireless
                    work ethic. He has a unique ability to intuitively absorb
                    and translate artistic details, and he always communicates
                    with clarity, purpose and wisdom. But his genuine passion
                    for the music and the people he worked with was what made me
                    look forward to every show we played together.

                    with Marc again in any future projects.

                I adore working with Marc! An accomplished arranger, vocal
                director, music director, coach and orchestrator - Marc has the
                ability to make music lift off the page in ways unlike anyone
                else I have ever worked with. Entertaining and empathetic, Marc
                cares deeply about his coworkers. Marc is a trustworthy Vocal
                Director, always championing vocal health and the success of his
                performers. An accomplished musical theatre actor himself, Marc
                is endlessly supportive and never competitive. If he isn’t
                available, he’s the first to recommend A+ talent to replace
                himself (without the fear of becoming dispensable.) Marc’s work
                ethic speaks for itself as he is comfortable in any venue: from
                West End to cruise ships and everything in between. I happily
                recommend Marc as a creative genius and look forward to working
                with Marc for many years to come!

                I have worked with Marc now for over 5 years on a number of
                different commercial and theatre projects including Musical
                Starnights, a European Tour for which I was Creative Consultant.
                I have always found his energy and passion for his work second
                to none and I am always blown away with how he gets the absolute
                best out of the cast members. The industry can be stressful at
                times however Marc always keeps it cool and gets the job done!

                When I first spotted Marc at The Royal Academy of Music, I knew
                I had just seen a specially talented musician. I had no
                hesitation in adding him to my database, and used him at the
                first opportunity. I have always found Marc to be an
                enthusiastic performer, who fits in well with my group of highly
                talented singers.

                Marc's skills, talents, and professionalism are always evident
                in the work and projects he is a part of. It is always a
                pleasure to have him as part of the team as he brings his
                experience and expertise in to the room and to the project. His
                musical skills are augmented with his excellent communication
                and interpersonal skills that are always valued and appreciated
                by the other members of the production team, as well as each
                cast member. A true asset to any production.{' '}
